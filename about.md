# About Me
Ciao! I am a Computer Engineer from Italy. My interests lie in Deep Learning and Software Architectures.
I enjoy travelling, surfing, playing team sports and implementing ideas, for which I give my best through a compiler.

The idea behind this personal homepage is to share my current learning progresses (no real time) together with my thoughs and experiences around implementations and ideas.
