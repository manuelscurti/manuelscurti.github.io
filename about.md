# About Me

Ciao! I am a Computer Engineer from Italy. My interests lie in Software modelling, Large-scale distributed systems, Product development.
I enjoy travelling, surfing, playing team sports and implementing ideas, for which I give my best through a compiler.

The idea behind this personal homepage is to share my current learning progresses (no real time) together with my thoughs and experiences around implementations and ideas.

Back in 2012, I used to be a DJ and a electronic music producer. 

In those years, EDM (Electronic Dance Music) was booming all over the world, with artists like Avicii, Swedish House Mafia, Nicky Romero, Hardwell, Afrojack (and many more of that genre) being on top of Beatport and DJ Mag world rankings. 

This for sure influenced my musical tastes and styles, as you can hear from my Soundcloud profile, where I put most of my productions and experimentations. 

After 2 years, I stop this hobby to focus on my career track, but who knows if there will be a come back?

By the way, you may be wondering how amazing I was at producing music. Jokes aside, there you go. **enjoy**!
