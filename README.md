## Local development

After cloning the repo execute:

    $ bundle install 
    $ bundle exec jekyll serve

## Theme

This blog uses [`plainwhite` theme](https://github.com/samarsault/plainwhite-jekyll). 
I think it's great for its simplicity and minimalism. The only thing I modified to the original codebase, is the default mode, that now is set to dark mode.

**A reminder to myself of the future**: in case you forgot how to tweak configuration parameters and stuff of the theme, check the README.md inside the `plainwhite` repo.
